Hello. 

I need some help. I don't know is it right place to ask this kind of question, but I gonna try.  

So, long story short. I'm a beginner in Elm and I learn how to build things.  My goal for this project is to learn how to create Elm app which can contains kinda like applications with its own state. Ideally, what I would like to find is a way how to nest Elm Architectures inside Elm Architecture, so that nested Elm Architecture would contains its own model/view/update logic independent of other Elm Architectures. 

So, in pursuing this goal designed simple application, but it allows me to experiment with different options/variants which I called `dynamic counters`. Essentially its the same as first and most basic example of Elm Architecture where you can increase/decrease value of counter, but it also allows to add/remove counters dynamically. Each counter has it's own state that changes independently of other counters state.

Here completed implementation of application https://gist.github.com/SuperManEver/fb39754333fd185c808987b6123dca50

What I'd like you to do is take a lot at my app and give some feedback. Especially, I'd like to hear from you how I can make it more modular. What I mean by that is the following.  Currently it plays dual role, it acts as container for counters with ability to add/remove them and also it contains logic that allows each of them to change their state.  As I said earlier, ideally I'd like to nest Elm Architecture into another, so each counter will acts kinda like instance of Counter app. 

So with your help I'd like to move current implementation to this desired implementation as much as possible :slightly_smiling_face:


-> mapping the messages of your child module to the parent mostly
